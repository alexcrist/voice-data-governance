The Aphasia Center of West Texas came into being when Kathryn Shelley's father, Chuck Matthews, had a stroke that resulted in significant communication problems. Kathryn discovered that once his insurance ran out, no further communicative support and training was available to him. Kathryn spearheaded a community effort, which resulted in the establishment of the center in March, 2002, as the second independent aphasia center to open in the United States. The programs at this center reflect its life participation approach to aphasia care.",USA,TX,12,Aphasia Center of West Texas,AphasiaBank,https://aphasia.talkbank.org/access/English/Aphasia/ACWT.html,12,Not reported,Neuro,Aphasia,"free speech, prompted speech",English,Aphasia: 12,"The following tests are administered in conjunction with the discourse protocol:

Cambridge Cookie-Theft Corpus,"Corpus of Directed and Spontaneous Speech of Brain-Damaged Patients and Healthy Individuals. It provides a better understanding about the precise way in which impairments affect patients language, improves theories of how the brain processes language, and offers heuristics for diagnosing certain types of brain damage based on patients speech. One method for investigating usage differences involves the analysis of spontaneous speech. In the work described here we construct a text corpus consisting of transcripts of individuals speech produced during two tasks: the Boston-cookie-theft picture description task (Goodglass and Kaplan, 1983) and a spontaneous speech task, which elicits a semi-prompted monologue, and/or free speech. Interviews with patients from 19yrs to 89yrs were transcribed, as were interviews with a comparable number of healthy individuals (20yrs to 89yrs).

Early Mental Health Uncovering (EMU) dataset,"Mental illnesses are often undiagnosed, demonstrating need for an effective unbiased alternative to traditional screening surveys. For this we propose our Early Mental Health Uncovering (EMU) framework that supports near instantaneous mental illness screening with non-intrusive active and passive modalities. We designed, deployed, and evaluated the EMU app to passively collect retrospective digital phenotype data and actively collect short voice recordings. Additionally, the EMU app also administered depression and anxiety screening surveys to produce depression and anxiety screening labels for the data. Notably, more than twice as many participants elected to share scripted audio recordings than any passive modality. We then study the effectiveness of machine learning models trained with the active modalities. Using scripted audio, EMU screens for depression with F1=0.746, anxiety with F1=0.667, and suicidal ideation with F1=0.706. Using unscripted audio, EMU screens for depression with F1=0.691, anxiety with F1=0.636, and suicidal ideation with F1=0.667. Jitter is an important feature for screening with scripted audio, while Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficient is an important feature for screening with unscripted audio. Further, the frequency of help-related words carried a strong signal for suicidal ideation screening with unscripted audio transcripts. This research results in a deeper understanding of the selection of modalities and corresponding features for mobile screening. The EMU dataset will be made available to public domain, representing valuable data resource for the community to further advance universal mental illness screening research.",,,,,GitHub,https://github.com/mltlachac/EMU,60,120,Mood,"Depression, Anxiety, Control","free speech, reading",English,"Mental Disorders: 346, Controls: 363",PHQ-9 for depression and GAD-7 for anxiety,Available,Open,Data is downloadable from landing page,Not reported,"age, gender, education, student status",Smartphone standard microphone,YES,Not reported,Not reported

The Lab provides detailed speech and language diagnostics employing standardized testing, and also functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using the fMRI technology, we are able to look at brain changes associated with recovery, and also study how stroke size and location relates to language, speech, and motor impairments. All of the research conducted in the lab is funded by the National Institutes of Health and there is no charge for participation. Since the establishment of the USC Aphasia Lab, we have tested over 80 participants, and conducted numerous studies where participants received treatment to target receptive and expressive deficits.

Multi-modal Open Dataset for Mental-disorder Analysis (MODMA) Datset,"We present a multi-modal open dataset for mental-disorder analysis. For now, the dataset includes data mainly from clinically depressed patients and matching normal controls. All our patients were carefully diagnosed and selected by professional psychiatrists in hospitals. At this stage, only electroencephalogram (EEG) and speech recording data are made publicly available. The EEG signals were recorded as both in resting state and under stimulation. The EEG dataset includes not only data collected using traditional 128-electrodes mounted elastic cap, but also a novel wearable 3-electrode EEG collector for pervasive applications. The speech data were recorded as during interviewing, reading and picture description. Detail descriptions of each sub-dataset are listed accordingly in the download section. In the future, more data will be added regularly, which will cover not only more mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, anxiety and mania; but also more data types, such as eye-movement tracking, facial expression recording and MRIs. We encourage other researchers in the field to use it for testing their own methods of mental-disorder analysis. 

The MODMA voice database included the voice data of 52 subjects, including 23 patients with depression and 29 healthy controls. In the patients within the depression group, the age ranged from 18 to 52 years old. Further, in the healthy controls group, the age ranged from 19 to 52 years old. There were 36 males in the voice database, including 16 patients with depression and 20 healthy controls. There were 16 females, of whom 7 were depression patients and 9 healthy controls.

1. Each row can not be used independently, because is one of the three replications of one individual. Nature of data is dependent for each subject, but independent from one to another subject. So, traditional technique from machine learning can not be applied to this dataset, because those techniques are based on the independent nature of the instances. There are 240 instances but for only 80 subjects, so they are not independent. Techniques as those presented in Naranjo et al. (2016), Naranjo et al.

2. The concept of replication considered here does not match the classical concept of statistical repeated measurements. The term 'replications' refers to the collection of features extracted from voice recordings belonging to the same subject. Since, in this context, features are extracted from multiple consecutive voice recordings from the same subject, in principle, the features should be identical. The imperfections in technology and the own biological variability result in non-identical replicated features that are more similar to one another than features from different subjects.

Goal of the project: To reveal the underlying cause of disfluency, several authors use a network task, where participants describe the route taken by a marker through visually presented networks of objects. To be able to disentangle disfluency related to word preparation from other factors, we combined this task with eye-tracking. We asked whether delays in the earliest stages of picture naming elicit disfluency. We therefore used visual blurring which hinders visual identification of the items and thereby slows down selection of a lexical concept.

PRJNA289433,"Background: The application of polygenic risk scores (PRSs) in major depressive disorder (MDD) detection is constrained by its simplicity and uncertainty. One promising way to further extend its usability is fusion with other biomarkers. This study constructed an MDD biomarker by combining the PRS and voice features and evaluated their ability based on large clinical samples.

Methods: We collected genome-wide sequences and utterances edited from clinical interview speech records from 3,580 women with recurrent MDD and 4,016 healthy people. Then, we constructed PRS as a gene biomarker by p value-based clumping and thresholding and extracted voice features using the i-vector method. Using logistic regression, we compared the ability of gene or voice biomarkers with the ability of both in combination for MDD detection. We also tested more machine learning models to further improve the detection capability.

Conclusion: The addition of voice biomarkers to genes can effectively improve the ability to detect MDD. The combination of PRS and voice biomarkers in MDD detection is feasible. This study provides a foundation for exploring the clinical application of genetic and voice biomarkers in the diagnosis of MDD.",,,,,European Nucleotide Archive,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJNA289433?show=related-records,7596,Not reported,Mood,Major Depressive Disorder (MDD),free speech,Chinese,"Depression: 3,580, Controls: 4,016","genome-wide sequences and utterances edited from clinical interview speech records, Composite International Diagnostic Interview",Withdrawn,Open,Data is downloadable from landing page,Not reported,"sex, race, ethnicity, accent, age, education, occupation, marital status, social class",Not reported,YES,8 kHz,Not reported

Gray Oral Reading Tests -- individuals with aphasia.

The 16 passages from the Gray Oral Reading test are transcribed in CHAT format. The transcripts were done to allow for automated analysis using the SCRIPT program in CLAN (Section 7.22 in the CLAN manual). HOWEVER, individual researchers will need to modify the transcripts based on their criteria for acceptable vs unacceptable error productions. Acceptable error productions are marked with square brackets and a single colon; unacceptable error productions are marked with square brackets and a double colon.

The dysarthric speakers (7 female, 13 male) reported a diagnosis of cerebral palsy and ranged in age from 12 years old to 37 years old.

The speech data was collected between 2015 and 2017 in two sessions at NIEPMD. In total, each speaker recorded 365 utterances consisting of single words and of sentences that included a combination of common and uncommon Tamil phrases.

Stuttering Events in Podcasts Dataset (SEP-28k),"The ability to automatically detect stuttering events in speech could help speech pathologists track an individual’s fluency over time or help improve speech recognition systems for people with atypical speech patterns. Despite increasing interest in this area, existing public datasets are too small to build generalizable dysfluency detection systems and lack sufficient annotations. In this work, we introduce Stuttering Events in Podcasts (SEP-28k), a dataset containing over 28k clips labeled with five event types including blocks, prolongations, sound repetitions, word repetitions, and interjections. Audio comes from public podcasts largely consisting of people who stutter interviewing other people who stutter.

Wisconsin Registry for Alzheimer’s Prevention (WRAP),"The WRAP is a longitudinal study of late-middle-aged adults enriched for AD risk based on parental family history. WRAP participants are asymptomatic, English speaking, and are between the ages of 40 and 65 at the time of enrollment (Sager et al., 2005; Johnson et al., 2017). Approximately 72% of participants have a parent with either autopsy-confirmed or probable AD [family history positive (FH+)] as defined by the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s disease and Related Disorders Association (NINCDS-ADRDA) criteria (McKhann et al., 1984). The sample has a higher-than-average proportion of carriers of at least one ε-4 allele of the APOE gene, therefore are at higher genetic risk for sporadic AD than the general population (Liu et al., 2013). Approximately 28% of participants had no parental history of AD and met the criteria that their mothers survived to at least age 75, and their fathers to at least age 70, with no dementia [family history negative (FH-)].

The WRAP study began in 2001 and currently has enrolled 1551 participants, primarily from the upper Midwest. The sample is 71% women, 88% white, and has a mean age at baseline of 54 years. The longitudinal study design includes a baseline visit, followed by a second visit 4 years later, and serial follow-up visits every 2 years thereafter. Participants are tested at one of three sites: Madison, LaCrosse, and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. WRAP participants undergo an extensive neuropsychological battery at each visit, and collection of a spontaneous language sample began at the third wave visit in 2012. This study was approved by The University of Wisconsin–Madison’s Institutional Review Board.
